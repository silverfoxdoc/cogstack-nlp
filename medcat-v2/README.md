# Medical  <img src="https://github.com/CogStack/cogstack-nlp/blob/main/media/cat-logo.png?raw=true" width=45> oncept Annotation Tool (version 2)

MedCAT can be used to extract information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and link it to biomedical ontologies like SNOMED-CT, UMLS, or HPO (and potentially other ontologies).
Original paper for v1 on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01165). 

**There's a number of breaking changes in MedCAT v2 compared to v1.**
When moving from v1 to v2, please refer to the [migration guide](docs/migration_guide_v2.md).
Details on breaking are outlined [here](docs/breaking_changes.md).

## Available Models

We have 2 public v2 models available:
1) SnomedCT UK Clinical edition 39.0 (Oct 2024) and UK Drug Extension 39.0 (July 2024) based model enriched with UMLS 2024AA; trained only on MIMIC-IV
2) SnomedCT UK Clinical edition 40.2 (June 2025) and UK Drug Extension 40.3 (July 2024) based model enriched with UMLS 2024AA; trained only on MIMIC-IV

We also have a number of MedCAT v1 models available:
1) UMLS Small (A modelpack containing a subset of UMLS (disorders, symptoms, medications...). Trained on MIMIC-III)
2) SNOMED International (Full SNOMED modelpack trained on MIMIC-III)
3) UMLS Dutch v1.10 (a modelpack provided by UMC Utrecht containing [UMLS entities with Dutch names](https://github.com/umcu/dutch-umls) trained on Dutch medical wikipedia articles and a negation detection model [repository](https://github.com/umcu/negation-detection/)/[paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2209.00470) trained on EMC Dutch Clinical Corpus).
4) UMLS Full. >4MM concepts trained self-supervised on MIMIC-III. v2022AA of UMLS.
5) The same 2024 based model as above in v1 format
6) The same 2025 based model as above in v1 format

To download any of these models, please [follow this link](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/login?service=https://medcat.sites.er.kcl.ac.uk/auth-callback) (or [this link for API key based download](https://medcat.sites.er.kcl.ac.uk/auth-callback-api)) and sign into your NIH profile / UMLS license. You will then be redirected to the MedCAT model download form. Please complete this form and you will be provided a download link.

While we encourage you use MedCAT v2 and the models in that native format, if you download an older version MedCAT v2 will be able to load it and covnert it to the format it knows. However, the loading process will be considerably longerin those cases.

If you wish you can also convert the v1 models into the v2 format (see [tutorial](../medcat-v2-tutorials/notebooks/introductory/migration/1._Migrate_v1_model_to_v2.ipynb)).

```python
from medcat.utils.legacy import legacy_converter
from medcat.storage.serialisers import AvailableSerialisers
old_model = '<path to old v1 model>'
new_model_dir = '<dir to place new model in>'
legacy_converter.do_conversion(old_model_path, new_model_dir, AvailableSerialisers.dill)
```
OR
```bash
model_path = "models/medcat1_model_pack.zip"
new_model_folder = "models"  # file in this folder
! python -m  medcat.utils.legacy.legacy_converter $model_path $new_model_folder --verbose
```

## Installation

MedCAT v2 has its first full release
```
pip install medcat
```
Do note that **this installs only the core MedCAT v2**.
**It does not necessary dependencies for `spacy`-based tokenizing or MetaCATs or DeID**.
However, all of those are supported as well.
You can install them as follows:
```
pip install "medcat[spacy]" # for spacy-based tokenizer
pip install "medcat[meta-cat]"  # for MetaCAT
pip install "medcat[deid]"  # for DeID models
pip install "medcat[spacy,meta-cat,deid,rel-cat,dict-ner]"  # for all of the above
```

### Version / update checking

MedCAT now has the ability to check for newer versions of itself on PyPI (or a local mirror of it).
This is so users don't get left behind too far with older versions of our software.
This is configurable by evnironmental variables so that sys admins (e.g for JupyterHub) can specify the settings they wish.
Version checks are done once a week and the results are cached.

Below is a table of the environmental variables that govern the version checking and their defaults.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **`MEDCAT_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK`** | *(unset)* | When set to `true`, `yes` or `disable`, disables the version update check entirely. Useful for CI environments, offline setups, or deployments where external network access is restricted. |
| **`MEDCAT_PYPI_URL`** | `https://pypi.org/pypi` | Base URL used to query package metadata. Can be changed to a PyPI mirror or internal repository that exposes the `/pypi/{pkg}/json` API. |
| **`MEDCAT_MINOR_UPDATE_THRESHOLD`** | `3` | Number of newer **minor** versions (e.g. `1.4.x`, `1.5.x`) that must exist before MedCAT emits a “newer version available” log message. |
| **`MEDCAT_PATCH_UPDATE_THRESHOLD`** | `3` | Number of newer **patch** versions (e.g. `1.3.1`, `1.3.2`, `1.3.3`) on the same minor line required before emitting an informational update message. |
| **`MEDCAT_VERSION_UPDATE_LOG_LEVEL`** | `INFO` | Logging level used when reporting available newer versions (minor/patch thresholds). Accepts any valid `logging` level string (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`). |
| **`MEDCAT_VERSION_UPDATE_YANKED_LOG_LEVEL`** | `WARNING` | Logging level used when reporting that the current version has been **yanked** on PyPI. Accepts the same values as above. |

## Demo

The MedCAT v2 demo web app is available [here](https://medcat.sites.er.kcl.ac.uk/).

## Key Concepts

- **Components**: The building blocks of MedCAT (NER, Entity Linking, preprocessing, etc.)
- **Addons**: Components that extend the core NER+EL pipeline with additional processing stages
- **Plugins**: External packages that provide new component implementations or other functionality via entry points

See [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md) for detailed information.

## Tutorials
A guide on how to use MedCAT v2 is available at [MedCATv2 Tutorials](../medcat-v2-tutorials).
However, the tutorials are a bit of a work in progress at this point in time.


## Acknowledgements
Entity extraction was trained on [MedMentions](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/MedMentions) In total it has ~ 35K entites from UMLS

The vocabulary was compiled from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) In total ~ 800K unique words
